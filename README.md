# BP15's CHANGES

Instead of the photos going straight to the bepinex path, it creates a folder in the bepinex path called "HandCaptures" so your bepinex path isnt flooded with photos

The scoreboard that normally appears in the top right of your screen when in a lobby is now gone

The GUI is now always blue (hopefully in the future it will match your gorillas color)

## Compatibility
this mod is not compatible with any mods that change your perspective on your desktop.

This mod is not compatible with the oculus Software whatsoever. This means that Hand Movement and UI click will break on the oculus version.

## What does it do?
This Mod adds: a Freecam, the possibility to use your mouse to click on buttons, Hand movement, Leave, Join codes, Generate a random private room, toggle comp lobbies on and off, Xray, TP, Gravity  and it adds labels that display the roomcode and the playercount.


## Why is my UI not showing up?
Your UI not showing up could have several reasons following


reason 1: Your SteamVR probably is still trying to connect to the VR headset or is connected to it. How to fix it: Close SteamVR if your VR headset isn't connected.


reason 2: Your HideManagerGameObject is set to false Scroll down to find how to fix it(Why are my modded room options not showing up?)


## Don't get stuck in the wall

## How do I open the UI?
Press the TAB key on your keyboard.


## Freecam Movement


W: Forward movement


S: Backward movement


D: Right movement


A: Left Movement


K: to flip people off


J: to make a fist


L: thumbs up

PC: C for a photo on camera VR: Y and right trigger for photo on camera

Scroll wheel to change air handmovement distance of air handmovement mode.

Hold your left mouse button and move it around to turn your perspective horizontally and vertically!

## Why can't I join non moddeds?

The mod doesn't allow you to join non moddeds because it's to prevent room hopping and cheating.

this mod only allows you to join non moddeds when it's disabled or when a vr is connected.

## Where are my photos saved?

The photos are being saved in your BepInEx folder.

## Why do my modded room options not show up?

It's because the bepinex config automatically sets HideManagerGameObject to false, you wanna set that to true and I will guide you through it:


Step 1: Go to your steam library and press on gorilla tag.


Step 2: Click on the settings icon and do as shown in the picture

Step 3: Click on Browse local files in the Manage category


Step 4: Once you're in the Gorilla Tag folder look for the BepInEx folder


Step 5: If you found it click on it a config folder in the BepInEx folder should show up, click on it.


Step 6: Search for BepInEx.cfg if you found it open it up with a text editor like Editor, Wordpard etc...


Step 7: press the control and f key at the same time a similar window should show up that looks like this

Step 8: Search for HideManagerGameObject in the "Search for" bar

 
Step 9: If set on false set it to true, you can leave the default value alone.


You're done

## How do I join rooms?
Make sure you're in the forest map and then press "join random"


Alternative:


step 1: If your game mode isn't set to modded casual use the new button that says "switch mode to modded casual"


step 2: generate a room with the "generate room" button.


step 3: use your freecam to move above the join trigger at stump(just like the added example)

step 4: press the "Leave Room" button.


step 5: Wait until you join a room and you're done.
